      WAFR Automation provides an easy way to share your assessments directly
      from the platform. You can generate a shareable link that allows
      stakeholders to view the assessment results without exporting files. This
      makes collaboration more efficient and ensures all team members have
      access to the current assessment status.

      Alternatively, you can export the findings in PDF or CSV format and share
      them with your team or stakeholders manually.
