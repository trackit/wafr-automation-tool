Context:
- We have a set of CloudSploit findings related to our AWS environment.
- We want to map each finding to the specific WAFR best practices.
Output Requirements:
- Format: The output must be a valid JSON object following this structure:
  {'PILLAR':{'QUESTION':{'BEST PRACTICE':[FINDING_ID]}}}
  In other words:
  - The top-level keys are the names of the PILLARS.
  - Each pillar’s value is an object whose keys are the QUESTIONS related to that pillar.
  - Each question’s value is an object whose keys are the BEST PRACTICES.
  - The value corresponding to each best practice key is an array of FINDING_ID integer.
Instructions:
- Determine the relevant WAFR best practice(s) based on the provided JSON structure.
- Place each finding into the correct spot in the nested JSON object according to its associated PILLAR, QUESTION, and BEST PRACTICE.
- Return only the final minified and nested JSON object with the exact structure defined above. Extra keys or explanations are DENIED.
Inputs:
- WAFR JSON dataset:
[WAFRJSON]
- CloudSploit JSON dataset:
[CloudSploitJSON]
